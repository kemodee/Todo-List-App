# Todo List App

>This is my first React Native app. It's a simple Todo List app that includes: layouts from react native, reusable components, styling for react native components, adding and removing items from state, user input, TextInput component, KeyboardAvoidingView component and more!

A todo list contains all the daily stuff which we need to work on. So the example of a todo list is a collection of the things you want to get done by the end of the day. This is a pretty simple app with an add and delete function. You may not find too many details but it's a great sample of some of the things I learned in my React Native course at the Nucamp coding bootcamp.

## Key Features

>Adding a Task

Upon opening the App you can add a new task by clicking on the text box at the bottom of the screen.

>Deleting a Task

Once you have added a task you also have the option to delete the task by simply clicking on it.

Here's an screenshot of the app after you've added a task. The task in this screenshot is just a sample:

#### Footnote

This app was built using React Native which is an exciting framework that enables web developers to create robust mobile applications using their existing JavaScript knowledge. It offers faster mobile development, and more efficient code sharing across iOS, Android, and the Web, without sacrificing the end userâ€™s experience or application quality.
